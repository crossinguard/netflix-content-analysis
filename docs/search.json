Those columns were then lengthened so each multi-value entry was broken up into new separate rows.\n\n# exclude multi-value columns\ndf_content &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(-director, -cast, -country, -listed_in)\n\n# separate df and lengthen for director\ndf_director &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(show_id, director) %&gt;%\n  separate_longer_delim(director, delim = \", \")\n\n# separate df and lengthen for cast\ndf_cast &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(show_id, cast) %&gt;%\n  separate_longer_delim(cast, delim = \", \")\n\n# separate df and lengthen for country\ndf_country &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(show_id, country) %&gt;%\n  separate_longer_delim(country, delim = \", \")\n\n# separate df and lengthen for genre\ndf_genre &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(show_id, listed_in) %&gt;%\n  rename(genre = listed_in) %&gt;% # rename column\n  separate_longer_delim(genre, delim = \", \")\n\nDuring this phase it was discovered that several countries had a trailing comma, which was confirmed to exist in the original dataset.

This converts a string-based value of “September 25, 2021” into a date-based value of “2021-09-25” in the ISO 8601 international date standard.\n\n# convert date format and data type\ndf_content &lt;- df_content %&gt;%\n  mutate(date_added = as.Date(date_added, format = \"%B %d, %Y\"))\n\n\nVerify changes\n\n# preview date_added values\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  select(show_id, type, date_added) %&gt;%\n  head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue 3: rating =&gt; duration\nA value count of the rating column in df reveals three misplaced duration values.\n\n# rating value counts\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  count(rating)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# view entries with \"min\" in rating\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  filter(grepl(\"min\", rating)) %&gt;%\n  select(title, rating, duration)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe three “Louis C.K.” titles incorrectly indicate a duration in place of a rating. To correct the issue I copied the misplaced values into duration and updated the values in rating to be NA missing values\n\n# replace \"min\" values in rating with NA and copy to duration\ndf_content &lt;- df_content %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    duration = ifelse(grepl(\" min\", rating), rating, duration),\n    rating = ifelse(grepl(\" min\", rating), NA, rating)\n  )\n\n\nVerify changes\n\n# verify changes - rating value counts\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  count(rating)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# verify changes - view entries with \"min\" in rating\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  filter(grepl(\"min\", rating)) %&gt;%\n  select(title, rating, duration)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# verify changes - view entries with \"Louis\" in title\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  filter(str_starts(title, \"Louis\")) %&gt;%\n  select(title, rating, duration)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDuring verification if was confirmed that the rating column now only contains rating values and that the “Louis” titles have been corrected.\n\n\n\nIssue 4: duration\nI addressed the mixed units in the duration column by separating the column into two columns, one containing tv shows (duration_n_seasons) and the other movies (duration_mins). In both cases I removed the trailing characters (i.e., units) and converted the values into numeric data types. The originalduration column was preserved.\n\n# create new columns for duration\ndf_content &lt;- df_content %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    duration_n_seasons = ifelse(type == \"TV Show\", as.numeric(str_remove(duration, \" .*\")), NA),\n    duration_mins = ifelse(type == \"Movie\", as.numeric(str_remove(duration, \" .*\")), NA)\n  )\n\n\nVerify changes\n\n# preview duration values\ndf_content %&gt;%\n  select(type, duration, duration_n_seasons, duration_mins)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow Summary\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"htmlLabels\": false}} }%%\nflowchart TB\n  import([\"import data as df\"])\n  identify[\"identify issues\"]\n  adjust[\"adjust date format, misplaced values, inconsistent units\"]\n  content([\"df_content\"])\n  lengthen([\"lengthen multi-value columns\"])\n  multi([\"df_director\n  df_cast\n  df_country\n  df_genre\"])\n\n  import --- identify --- adjust --- content\n  identify --- lengthen --- multi"

Are there certain decades when one content type was more prevalent than the other? What do you think might have influenced these variations in content distribution across decades?\nHigh-Performing Years: Identify the top five years with the highest combined count of ‘Movies’ and ‘TV Shows’. Do these years share any common characteristics or trends? Does this align with any significant events or shifts in the entertainment industry during those years?\nShifts in Recent Years: Focus on the most recent decades available in the data. Have you noticed any changes in the balance between ‘Movies’ and ‘TV Shows’ during this period? Are there any insights you can draw from this shift, such as changes in audience preferences or content production strategies?\nContent Type Contribution to Average: Are there specific years or decades where the combined count of ‘Movies’ and ‘TV Shows’ exceeds the overall average, as indicated by the reference line? Conversely, can you identify periods where the content count falls below the average? What insights can you draw from these variations in terms of content production trends and their influence on the overall average?\n\n\n\n\nContent by Inclusion Date\n\nAbout\nA count of unique titles available on Netflix by the content’s inclusion date on the platform1.1 Netflix launched its streaming media service on January 2007\n\n\nInteraction\n\nThe Release Year filter indicates the maximum and minimum values present within the data.

Are there noticeable differences in the pattern of content inclusion? How might these differences reflect changes in content acquisition and licensing strategies over time?\nContent Spike Analysis: Identify any years where the content count significantly exceeds the average reference line. What factors or trends might explain these spikes in content additions? What predictions could be made about future years?\nContent Type Trends Over Time: Focus on a specific type of content by selecting an option from the Content Type legend and selecting either ‘Keep Only’ or ‘Exclude’. Observe its trend. Does the count of this content type increase steadily, exhibit fluctuations, or follow a different pattern? How does the average reference line differ between content types?2\nExploring Older Releases: Set the Release Year filter’s maximum value to your birth year. This will limit the visualization to exclude content released after your birth year (independent of the inclusion date it was added to Netflix). Focus specifically on ‘Movie’ content type. What insights can you draw about the platform’s inclusion of older films? How does the average number of movies added per year to the platform change depending on your definition of an “older” release?\n\n2 changes to the visualization may be undone by selecting either the ‘undo’ or ‘reset’ icon from the bottom graphic menu\nTableau dashboard under construction, more worksheets coming soon!"
